## 0.1.0 (2016-08-29)

  - Establish initial file layout
  - Add "hybrid" (semi-automated) tests for several projects to standardize and accelerate manual testing.  
    NOTE: many of these could later be converted to fully-automated tests for use by CI pipeline.
  - Add "demo" project for use as project template 
  - Add _utils directory to house infra tools for use by Ops and FirefoxTestEng teams (i.e.  daily maintenance jobs, slave setup, global prefs, etc.)
